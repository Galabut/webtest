                The domestic cat (Felis catus[2] or Felis silvestris catus[4]) is a small, <br/>
                usually furry, domesticated, and carnivorous mammal. It is often called a housecat <br/>
                when kept as an indoor pet,[6] or simply a cat when there is no need to distinguish it <br/>
                from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship, <br/>
                and their ability to hunt vermin and household pests.
                <p>
                    Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible <br/>
                    bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing <br/>
                    small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats <br/>
                    can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those <br/>
                    made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other <br/>
                    mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. </p>
